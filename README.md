<p align="center"> I ask that you use tonetags when speaking with me, please! Jokingly flirting is okay, too; anything more is discomforting.
<p align="center"> My public whispers are (usually) off for a reason, please respect that. 💚 If you're trying to crown me I thank you in advance :]
<p align="center"> For a fair warning, if you're overly sexual in public chat there's a high chance you will be ignored/muted temporarily (usually 24hr) !!

<p align="center"> Also I mean this in the nicest way possible; DDVAU / Double Hearted AU bootlickers don't interact. I have personal opinions towards the creators & staffing and I'd appreciate if people who act like they 'do no wrong' kindly don't interact with me; I am  however totally willing to discuss why I'm not fond of them. Each opinion to their own. /Gen
<p align="center"> Ponies are still okay to interact, though! But if you heavily indulge in the AU with no thought of whose behind it.. please don't /Silly
<p align="center"> Also if you act like certain HC/LifeSMP artists are like "gods" or "better than others" dni either you're weird sorry

<p align="center"> Spreading around lies about my actions that I did as a <b>child</b> after 5+ years is immature and stupid. Leave me alone.
<p align="center"> You know who you are.
