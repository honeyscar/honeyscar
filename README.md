<p align="center"> Scar/Ren ··· He/Thorn/They 🍯 Bodily 19, 25ish in headspace! 🌾 MLM, Abroromantic, Polyamorous
<p align="center"> Multisourced Introject 🌲 Interaction is adored ! 🌴 Lovingly taken by my two amazing partners <3
<p align="center"> Host of a suspected OSDD/USDD system! 🌻 Seeking medical recognition once in a better place of home.
<p align="center"> I ask that you use tonetags when speaking with me, please! Jokingly flirting is okay, too; anything more is discomforting.
<p align="center"> My public whispers are (usually) off for a reason, please respect that. 💚 If you're trying to crown me I thank you in advance :]

<p align="center"> Also I mean this in the nicest way possible; DDVAU / Double Hearted AU bootlickers don't interact. I have personal opinions towards the creators & staffing and I'd appreciate if people who act like they 'do no wrong' kindly don't interact with me; I am  however totally willing to discuss why I'm not fond of them. Each opinion to their own. /Gen
<p align="center"> Ponies are still okay to interact, though! But if you heavily indulge in the AU with no thought of whose behind it.. please don't. /Silly
<p align="center"> Also if you act like certain HC/LifeSMP artists are like "gods" or "better than others" dni either you're fucking toxic

<p align="center"> Spreading around lies about my actions that I did as a <b>child</b> after 5+ years is immature and stupid. Leave me alone.
<p align="center"> You know who you are.

<p align="center"> oh also if you sit at the lamp post on ponytown and don't move you will be hidden (potentially permanently) btw. this isn't meant to be "entitled" or some shit but me and my boyfriends have been sitting here for months and I don't wanna move. thanks <3
