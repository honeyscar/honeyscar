<p align="center"> Also I mean this in the nicest way possible; DDVAU / Double Hearted AU bootlickers don't interact. I have personal opinions towards the creators & staffing and I'd appreciate if people who act like they 'do no wrong' kindly don't interact with me; I am  however totally willing to discuss why I'm not fond of them. Each opinion to their own. /Gen
<p align="center"> Ponies are still okay to interact, though! But if you heavily indulge in the AU with no thought of whose behind it.. please don't. /Silly
